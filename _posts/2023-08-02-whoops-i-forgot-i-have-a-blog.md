## My Bad

So I didn't completely forget all at once. I definitely meant for this to be updated at least once a month, if not every other week or so, especially for the job hunt. But then summer hit and I got a little busy, and _then_ I got even more stressed and busy because _I got a tech job_.

Once again for the people in the back...

# I got a job in tech

And _wayyyy_ faster than I thought, too! They contacted me early-mid June 2022, and I had a couple of interviews in June and early July. By the second week of July, I had an offer! Now, it was an Apprenticeship position, and the company had partnered with my bootcamp, so I had a slight advantage there. I honestly didn't think I would get a call, though. I'm more than a reasonable commute away from their closer regional offices, and have no real intention to move, but I figured I can put up with a lot for six months. The apprenticship program was for a full year, but I know that the first tech industry job is the most difficult to snag. Once you've been in the industry for six months, the second job is loads easier, from what I've heard.

But! Turns out they have a smaller satellite office in my city, and that office was happy to take on a few local apprentices! I don't think that was the only reason they took a chance on me, but it certainly helped.

The company I now work for is a global technology and business consulting company which contracts out to a _huge_ variety of industries, for technical and advisory purposes. The apprentice program was specifically designed to draw in fresh talent from non-traditional backgrounds (like a grocery store baker fresh out of bootcamp). While I've been forgetting that I have a personal website and blog, I've been working along through this apprentice program. I was placed in SQA within a client team, and have been learning the ropes of functional testing. This spring, I was also given a crash course in the Java framework with Selenium in order to support automated testing as well! I like to think I've picked things up quickly and solidly, and it seems like both the client company and my official company think so as well. As of yesterday, I'm officially graduated out and am now a regular full-time employee!

I even got a promotion!

It's been a really busy year, and I'm going to make a point to come back and post a more detailed update of my life and career development sooner than _next year_. Maybe it'll even be this weekend! I've been focusing on my new job, my new _career_, this past year and I've let my personal programming development fall a bit to the wayside. But I intend to slowly start ramping up my coding life again (along with my other 50000 hobbies...). I have bigger plans that SQA, after all.

Until next time!
