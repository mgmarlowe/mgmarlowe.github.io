I did my first technical challenge today for a job application! It was four tasks, and I had an hour and a half. I went in knowing it would be difficult, and that I would most likely run out of time way before I was finished, but thinking I would say least be able to make a good showing.

**I got 32%.**

The only task I got completely right was with SQL, and there was a task about debugging some JavaScript code, which I fixed one bug and knew about one other that I couldn't figure out how to fix. I paused in that one and looked through the other two. One, I figured out the logic I would need but didn't know how to implement it, and the other I had no clue how to solve.

I've spent the rest of the day feeling like an absolute failure. *I should be at least better than this,* I've been telling myself. I should know more, of course.

But I don't. *And that's **okay***.

I can improve, still, of course. I'm going to do more practicing with code challenges, and work to improve my JavaScript skills, and my Python and SQL skills. This was only my first technical challenge, I'm only at the start of my search, of course I didn't have the right expectations.

I'm **not** a failure, I'm doing great. I could have done better, but I could have picked up coding when I was five and have my own tech company by now. But '*could have*' and '*should have*' are both so very unhelpful. My self-worth and my future are not build on hypothetical alternate futures, they're build on the choices I make and the actions I take. 

I'm doing **great**.
