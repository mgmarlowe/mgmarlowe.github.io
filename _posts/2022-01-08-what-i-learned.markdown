## What I Learned...  
### From making this site


1. The [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) are not very intuitive. That being said, they are pretty useful once you know what to look for, and once you've learned a little about how it works. Not so great for a pure beginner of personal websites, Ruby, Liquid, or Jekyll.  
2. Always check if what you're copy/paste-ing should have single or double quotes. Even people who have developed a feature for the particular program you're messing with might not always edit their code right. Or maybe it was for an earlier version, and it used to work just fine.  
3. Scanning through pages and pages of themes for a website is frustrating and anxiety-inducing. Especially when you're not really sure what you want your site to look like.
4. I'm not enamored enough with the idea of having the most beautiful personal site that I can't just be satisfied with a simpler theme to begin with. I will be able to update this site as I want later.




#### What I still don't know
_About making this site..._


1. How do I change the theme?? I tried so many ways, but even using the built-in GitHub themes wouldn't show up once deployed. There were no errors, only blank white pages. I'm sure it had something to do with not starting from a brand new repository, but I'd already put my personal GH Page up and didn't think I needed to delete it. 
2. How do I use remote themes? I thought I'd use one, as I couldn't manage to get the GH supported themes up and running, but no. No matter how much I fiddled with the files or how many gems/plugins I added, nothing worked.  
3. My header title (the big MG Marlowe up top) does nothing when clicked. It's supposed to take you back to the main page, like most sites, but it doesn't and I don't know why. I had to make a "Home" button for the nav bar and link it back to the main page, so I have a workaround for now, but it's still a mystery. Why doesn't it work???



That's all I've got for now. It's late, and I'm being hustled to bed.   
Good night, and good luck.
