So I've been applying for jobs lately, of course. I head back from one that seems pretty cool! I'm almost certain it was an automated thing, meaning I passed the lowest bars of _Has A Pulse_ and _Applied For This Job_ which is fine. I saw the job posted on LinkedIn, so I'm sure there were dozens of applicants, at the very least, so they have to cut down the first group somehow. This is actually a really helpful way to do so.

The coding assessment looks really cool. Instead of code challenges, which I have **feelings** about, it's a project-based assessment on the Hatchways platform. Which also looks awesome and I plan to utilize at earliest convenience. It's for backend API development, which I'm cool with, but it's only offered in Ruby on Rails...

Guess I'm learning Ruby now?

It's actually pretty awesome. I love new languages, apparently both human and coding, so it's great to have doing so moved up my priority list.

I've gone through most of the Codecademy course on Ruby, mainly just the stuff that doesn't look like something I imediately recognize from JavaScript or Python. It really does feel like Python with more symbols. I really like it so far. I've just downloaded Rails and started my first template app using the [Rails "Getting Started" guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), so I haven't gotten far, but I'm interested to see that it has database things built right in.

It may take me the whole ten days to get through this, but the company says how long I take is the least important factor in how I do. I'm hoping they look at my full-time job and continuing bootcamp and having to learn the language & framework and are impressed by what I can do anyway.

Here we go!
