### Free Time: Time Confetti Solutions

[**Free Time**](https://freetimesolutions.netlify.app/) is a solution list for 'time confetti.' Time confetti are the small fragments of time we have that many of us spend idly scrolling through the internet. While much of the solution for this issue is to be aware of our tendency to shred our own time, much of the time we simply can't think of any other use for a spare five or fifteen minutes. Free Time has lists of solutions, grouped by the amout of time you have and with helpful links for more information about each solution.

The [app](https://github.com/mgmarlowe/FreeTime) was created in React, with reactstrap for design. My plans for it's future involve MongoDB and Auth0. Users will be able to sign up and create their own time solutions, as well as hiding the old ones permanently and deleting or updating their custom solutions.

### Inheritance

[**Inheritance**](https://github.com/mgmarlowe/Inheritance) is a text based investigation game where you're trying to discover what happened to your uncle, who disappeared years ago. Written in Python, this is a classic style of computer game and was vary fun to make. In the future, I plan to make a front end for this so it can be played in a browser.

### Sketch

[**Sketch**](https://mgmarlowe.github.io/sketch/) is a simple digital mock of an etch-a-sketch. Drag your mouse over the squares to draw pictures and doodles. Once your done, just hit the clear button, and you can start fresh with the same amount of squares or you can specify a new grid size to play with.

This [program](https://github.com/mgmarlowe/sketch) was written using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was an early success in my coding journey that I'm pleased with still. In the future, I would like to add a button to change the color theme.
