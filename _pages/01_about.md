### Hi, my name is Melyssa and I'm switching careers!

Being a baker in an excellent grocery store chain has been an awesome experience. I've learned a variety of way how to not burn myself, and when the pandemic hit I spent no time in quarantine but a lot of time advising my mother on the best ways to knead her new sourdough bread. (Her success varied...)

Unfortunately, bakeries don't provide a lot of challenge once you've gotten the requisite skillset. I tried managment for a while, but that still didn't provide the sort of mental workout I need in order to not be bored. I had dabbled in learning C++ during the start of my stint in managment, excited about being able to get Unreal Engine 4 for free. While I didn't dedicate myself to learning this for long, it was interesting enough that programming was on my short list of things to learn in my down time.

After the pandemic hit, then started to settle, I really began to feel the stagnation in the bakery. After some serious deliberation, I decided to pursue web development and switch careers. I stepped down from managment to focus on learning as much as I could, and decided to enroll in a bootcamp. [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/) had a hybrid model I liked, and I've since completed their backend development and front end development courses, and will complete the smaller backend module in June that will complete their full-stack course.

The bootcamps have, overall, been a great experience. They've given me a lot of structure on my learning journey, as well as a great community that I can lean on when I have an issue.

They have taken up a **lot** of my time, though. Once I get a job in the tech industry, I'll be programming more of each day and can spend more time on hobbies that I've had to put aside. I'm particularly excited to get back into learning Japanese and spend more time dedicated to those studies. (I've gotten language textbooks that I haven't had time to get into, and I'm really itching to get at them!) I'll also be able to _actually_ have a garden I can tend, and be able to finish an embroidery project I've had for over a year. But my coding journey is important enough to set my hobbies aside for a while, and I don't regret it in the least.
